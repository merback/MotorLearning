% INPUT:
%
%   spg:     object representing the geometry space
%   msh:     object defining the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_multipatch)
%   patches: list of patches where the integrals have to be computed. By default, all patches are selected.

% OUTPUT:
%
%   mat:    derivative of assembled stiffness matrix by control points
